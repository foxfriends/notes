# Loop (Control Flow)

A __loop__ is a piece of code which will be executed multiple times, in a loop.
Loops are provided by most @[imperative][imperative-programming] languages as
one of the main @[control flow][] options, while @[functional][functional-programming]
languages often do not provide loops, and instead rely on @[recursion][].

There are a few common forms in which loops are often available:
*   @[Indexed `for` loops][]
*   @[`while` loops][]
*   @[`foreach` loops][]
*   @[Infinite loops][]
