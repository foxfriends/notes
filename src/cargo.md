# Cargo

Cargo is the @[Rust][] @[package manager][]. Cargo takes inspiration from @[NPM][] in its design,
featuring project-scoped dependencies so as not to conflict with other projects on the same system
using different versions of the same package (or, even, multiple dependencies within one package
using different versions of a shared dependency).
