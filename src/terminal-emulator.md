# Terminal Emulator

A __terminal emulator__ (often referred to simply as just a @[terminal][]) is a
program that can be used to run text-based programs in a @[graphical][graphical-user-interface] environment.

Most often you would use a terminal emulator to run a @[shell][], which in turn
would be used to run other programs, but a terminal (emulator) can typically be
started running any text-based program.

All computers come with a built in terminal emulator, but those are typically
pretty bare-bones, and people like to install nicer ones that provide features
like multiple tabs, ways to display images, or to provide other features that
go beyond just showing plain text. Examples of such programs include:

*   [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
*   [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
