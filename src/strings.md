# Strings

A __string__ is a way to represent text in a computer program as a sequence of characters.
Depending on the @[programming language][] these strings may be in one of many different
@[string encodings][].

Very commonly, strings are represented similarly to @[arrays][] of characters, but typically
implemented as a distinct type with optimizations and specialized @[methods][] for 
working with textual data in particular.
