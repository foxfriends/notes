# Web Animations

Always a tricky subject, to animate things on a website. When possible,
it's nicest to use pure @[CSS][] animations, but that's not always possible,
in which case @[Javascript][] animations are the way.

Built in to the browser is the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API),
or you can pick some packages of @[NPM][] instead.
