# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are one way of classifying programming styles.
@[Programming languages][] typically provide features of one or more programming
paradigms, allowing the users of those languages to combine them as needed.

Common paradigms include @[imperative programming][], @[functional programming][],
and @[object-oriented programming][], while less common ones include @[logic programming][]
and probably more that are so much less common that I cannot think of them.
