# Functional Programming

__Functional programming__ is one of the more popular @[programming paradigms][programming-paradigm],
notably featuring heavy use of @[first-class functions][] and @[lambdas][] to
aid in developing correct code and to facilitate easy code-reuse.

In functional programming there is often no sequencing of operations, @[looping][loop-control-flow],
side-effects, or @[mutation][]. Instead, the emphasis is placed on writing @[pure functions][]
which return values, and the program is written more like an equation (or series of equations)
relating those values. The idea is that, by writing simple, pure functions, it becomes easier
to reason about the correctness of the code, and to @[mathematically prove][mathematical-proof]
such correctness.

Examples of functional programming languages include @[Haskell][], @[Lisp][], and @[ML][ml-language]
(each of which have started their own family of similar languages) while some more fundamentally
@[imperative languages][], such as @[Javascript][] and @[Rust][] include features to support some
degree of functional programming.

Functional programming stems from the @[Lambda Calculus][].
