# Symbol (Type)

The symbol type, also sometimes called the atom type, is a @[primitive type][primitive-types]
that is available in some @[languages][programming-language]. The symbol type is interpreted
not to have any particular meaning other than to be a value that is unique from all other
values (even other symbols).

@[Ruby][] is one language which makes great use of symbols, as is @[Prolog][] (as atoms).
@[Javascript][] also has symbols, though used less frequently in most user-facing code.
