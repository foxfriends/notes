Programming examples, when describing something in a particular
@[language][programming-language], will obviously use that language. However, for
code samples written without a language in mind are just made up to make whatever
is being expressed most convenient. Typically that will be something inspired by
one of @[Haskell][], @[Javascript][], or @[Prolog][], so familiarity with those
may be of use.
