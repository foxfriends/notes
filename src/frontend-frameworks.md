# Frontend Frameworks

__Frontend frameworks__ are packages (often @[Javscript][] packages, but not always) that
help with building @[frontend web][] applications.

The popular choice is @[React][react-js], but my preferred and recommended choice
is @[Svelte][svelte-js]. Other options are @[Vue][vue-js] or @[Angular][angular-js],
but I have nothing in particular to say about those.

Non-Javascript framework options do exist,such as [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)
for @[Rust][], or @[Elm][].
