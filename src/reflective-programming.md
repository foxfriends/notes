# Reflective Programming

__Reflective programming__, or __reflection__, is the ability for a piece of code
to access information about itself, such as to get access to the types of values
at @[runtime][], including the name of the type, its fields, @[methods][] and their
types.

Though not recommended for use in regular code, reflection is useful for @[metaprogramming][].

Not all @[languages][programming-language] provide reflection capabilities, as it
depends on the implementation of the language what reflection may be possible. Some
that do include:
*   @[Swift][]
*   @[Javascript][]
*   @[Java][]
