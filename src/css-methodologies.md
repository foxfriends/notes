# CSS Methodologies

Since @[CSS][], as a @[language][programming-language], language is relatively limited
in what can be written, __CSS methodologies__ provide rules by which developers can
write consistent CSS class names and selectors to help make their CSS documents easier
to follow. In the days before such methodologies were developed, it was just a mess to
try and figure out how the CSS worked, and as it grew, things just start conflicting and
causing problems.

Some popular ones include:
*   @[Block Element Modifier][block-element-modifier] (BEM)
*   Utility first, such as @[Tailwind][tailwind-css]
*   @[DRY CSS][]

As far as I can tell, most @[frontend frameworks][] are coming up with better ways of
encapsulating styles with components. Once styles are component-scoped, there is so
little to think about that such methodologies are no longer necessary.
