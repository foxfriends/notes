# Imperative Programming

__Imperative programming__ is one of the more popular @[programming paradigms][programming-paradigm],
in which a program is written as a sequence of steps, which are executed in order.
These steps typically modify the state of the program (stored in @[variables][])
via @[mutation][].

Typical imperative code makes heavy use of @[control flow][], such as conditionals
and @[loops][].

Compared to other paradigms, imperative programming behaves most similarly to the
way that computers actually execute programs, as a sequence of instructions. Examples of
truly imperative programming languages include @[C][] and @[Zig][]. Since imperative
programming on its own can sometimes be hard to work with, imperative languages
usually include features of @[object-oriented programming][], @[functional programming][]
or both, as well, while remaining fundamentally imperative. Such hybrid languages
include most languages which are in use today, such as @[C++][cplusplus], @[Rust][],
and @[Javascript][].
