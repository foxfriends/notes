# Database Roles

In a @[DBMS][database-management-system], __roles__ are a way of allowing different
users of the database to have access only to the parts they need. Every user (or
application) that connects to the database connects under one of these roles.

Such permissions include things like the ability to read or write data from specific
tables, to create and delete tables, or even to just log in to the database at all.

This concept of roles can be considered similar to the concept of users on your
operating system. Each user is allowed access to different parts of your computer,
and some users are even allowed to log in. Understanding this difference tends to
make setting up your database system much easier.
