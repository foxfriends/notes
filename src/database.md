# Database

One of my first loves of programming. Not sure why, most people don't really like them in my
experience. Something about the robustness and clarity of a well designed database gets me
every time.

Databases are used to store data, particularly structured data.

Databases are typically managed by a @[DBMS][database-management-system].
@[Relational databases][relational-database] in particular are often
interacted with using @[SQL][], while non-relational or @[NoSQL databases][nosql-database]
use other methods.
