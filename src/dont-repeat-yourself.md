# Don't Repeat Yourself

__Don't repeat yourself__ (DRY) is a practice that comes up often in programming
to mean "don't write the same code multiple times". The reasons are many:
1.  The code is harder to understand if you have to read it twice
2.  Bugs are harder to fix if you have to fix them twice
3.  Code is more annoying to write when there's a lot of copy pasting

The opposite of DRY is, of course, write everything twice (WET).
