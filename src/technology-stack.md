# Technology Stack

The technology stack, or __tech stack__, is the choice of
@[programming languages][programming-language] and other major tools and programs on
which an application is built. In @[full-stack development][], every developer is
responsible for the entire stack, while other development practices involve designating
different parts of the application to different teams.

Some well known stacks for web development include:
*   __LAMP__: @[Linux][], @[Apache][], @[MySQL][], @[PHP][] - A very old-style option, not recommended, but you may hear of it
*   __MEAN__: @[MongoDB][], @[Express][npm-express], @[AngularJS][angular-js], @[Node.js][] - Also falling out of style
*   __MERN__: @[MongoDB][], @[Express][npm-express], @[React][react-js], @[Node.js][] - Still popular, but I don't love React personally

By no means are you required to pick from the acronymized stacks, for my personal projects
I rarely use any of those parts, choosing instead @[PostgreSQL][], @[Rust][], @[Svelte][svelte-js],
@[GraphQL][] as they are just... a better experience? A little more work to put the
pieces together when there aren't so many resources to copy paste from, but I was never
one for using those anyway.
