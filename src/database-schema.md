# Database Schema

The __database schema__ is the definition of the @[relations][database-relation] and
their attributes in a @[relational database][]. The database schema also includes more 
than just tables and attributes, such as @[functions][], @[triggers][database-trigger],
custom data types, and @[constraints][database-constraint] that are referenced by
those tables.

The database schema is modified by using the Data Definition Language (DDL) of @[SQL][],
including commands such as:
*   `CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE`/`DROP TABLE` for managing tables
*   `CREATE FUNCTION`/`DROP FUNCTION` for managing functions
*   `CREATE TRIGGER`/`DROP TRIGGER` for managing triggers
