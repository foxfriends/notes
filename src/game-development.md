# Game Development

Game development is the development of @[video games][], which is easily an entire
subject on its own, consisting of problems, patterns, and techniques not seen in
most other types of applications. Having to both simulate an immersive world while
also rendering complex graphics is nothing like any other type of application.

Though @[object-oriented programming][] sounds like a good idea for games, and may get
you through a few simple games, the trend these days seems to be to use an
@[entity-component-system][] architecture, which is a pattern I have yet to find a use
for in any situation that is not a game.

In practice though, none of that really matters because it's easiest to just pick
a @[game engine][] off the shelf.

I would like to get into game development more, and build some more of my own. So far
I have made a few small ones, of which I have located just one:
