# GitHub

Not to be confused with @[Git][] itself, [GitHub][] is a website that hosts Git 
@[repositories][git-repository] publicly on the Internet.

[GitHub]: https://github.com

It is a common misconception among non-programmers that Git and GitHub are the same.
Take the time to correct them when they make such a mistake, so they can stop looking
so foolish.
