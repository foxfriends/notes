# Strong typing

A __strongly typed__ @[programming language][] is one in which the @[type system][] is strong,
as in it cannot be disregarded. In strongly typed languages, the type of a value cannot be
arbitrarily changed, only by code that correctly changes the type of the value, and can be
proven (to a degree) to do so correctly. Strong type systems provide the most guarantees that
code is not being called incorrectly.

The strongness of a type system is actually more of a spectrum, with some languages being
more or less strongly typed than others based on other properties they may have.

Languages with strong type systems include:
*   @[Rust][]
*   @[Haskell][]
