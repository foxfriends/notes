# Video Games

Though some might dispute the video game as an art form, I am pretty sure they count.
Combining graphics, sound, story, interaction, and engineering, maybe the video game
is the *most complete* art form?

Might as well list some of my favourites for now? Maybe these will turn into video
game reviews one day. Some big, some small, all fun. I try to organize them into 
genre for now, though some probably could be considered to span multiple.
