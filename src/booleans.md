# Booleans

A __boolean__ is a value which can be either true or false. They are named after
[George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), and are featured in
most @[programming languages][programming-language] as well as their own branch
of algebra, the [Boolean algebra][].

The basics of boolean logic are the three operators:
*   Not: `¬a` (often written in programming languages: `!a`)
*   Or: `a ∨ b` (`a || b`)
*   And: `a ∧ b` (`a && b`)
