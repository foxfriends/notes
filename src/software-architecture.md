# Software Architecture

Similar to but distinct from @[software engineering][], and only part of
the @[software development][] process, __software architecture__ encapsulates
the selection of the @[programming language][], the @[design patterns][] used,
and making other high-level design choices when developing an application.

Though all developers on a team should be both considering the architecture of
the code and how it can be improved, as well as participating in the active
development of the software, a software architect in particular should make
an effort to understand the system as a whole and identify such changes at a
larger scale.
