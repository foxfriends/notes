# First-Class Functions

__First-class functions__ refers to the treatment of @[functions][] as values, which is
supported by a number of @[programming languages][programming-language], typically
those that are @[functional][functional-programming] languages (or share qualities with
functional languages).

Though many languages support passing functions to other functions, not all such languages
would be considered to have first-class functions. @[C][], for example, does allow 
passing pointers to functions around, allowing many similar behaviours as first-class
functions would, but since you cannot truly create and pass functions around directly,
they would not be considered first-class.

Languages with first class functions include (among others):
*   @[Javascript][]
*   @[Haskell][] (and in fact, all functional languages)
*   @[Rust][]
