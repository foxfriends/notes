# Software Development

The process of creating software. Distinct from @[computer science][], which is
more theoretical, and @[software engineering][] and @[software architecture][],
which are only parts of software development, the full extent of __software development__
includes practical use of a number of @[tools][software-development-tools], writing
code, documenting that code, and then maintaining and updating it during the lifecycle
of the developed application.

Some different types of applications for software development:
*   @[Web development][]
*   @[Mobile development][]
*   @[Command line][] applications
*   @[Game development][]
