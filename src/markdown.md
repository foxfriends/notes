# Markdown

Markdown is a @[mark-up language][] that makes the plain-text version of
the expected output easy to read and write. Great for web content,
blog posts, and note taking, even these notes are written in Markdown.

Most of the time, Markdown is translated into @[HTML][] for display
on the web.
