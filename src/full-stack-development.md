# Full-Stack Development

Full-stack development does not refer to any particular type of work or project, just
that the developer is responsible for the full @[technology stack][], rather than just one
part of it in particular. A full stack developer often needs to work on all of
@[backend web][] development, @[database management][database-management-system],
@[frontend web][] development or @[mobile development][], as well as the @[devops][] work
of setting up the infrastructure to host the application.

Full-stack development situations often have a @[Node.js][] backend because frontend
developers tend to know @[Javascript][] already so this provides the least friction.
This has led to the rise in popularity of Node.js.
