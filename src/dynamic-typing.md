# Dynamic typing

__Dynamic typing__, as opposed to @[static typing][], is to defer checking the types
of values to @[runtime][]. Though this makes it easy to write functions which can be
called in a wide range of situations, and it may seem like that makes writing the
program easier, this is often not the case. While in small programs the flexibility
of a dynamic type system makes code quick to write, in large programs the flexibility
makes a program hard to understand and hard to reason about.

Dynamically typed languages I would also often consider to be
@[scripting languages][scripting-language], such as:
*   @[Javascript][]
*   @[Ruby][]
*   @[Python][]
