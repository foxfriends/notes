# Mark-Up Language

A mark-up language is a sort of @[programming language][] that is
typically not capable of writing functioning programs, but can be
used to annotate some text or data for interpretation in a larger
application. Common examples include @[HTML][] and @[Markdown][],
but there are many more.
