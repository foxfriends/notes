# Shell

The __shell__ is a program that interprets commands provided via a @[command line][] or
a @[script][scripts]. A shell runs in a @[terminal][] (or more often, @[terminal emulator][])
and so is purely text based.

Shells come with a built-in @[scripting language][] which is used to build scripts compatible
with that shell that combine other utility programs together to achieve particular goals.
Such scripting languages come with particular features such as @[piping][function-piping],
variable/command @[interpolation][string-interpolation], and easy ways to interact with the
@[file system][] and @[operating system][].

Some examples of common shells include:
*   @[`sh`][shell-sh]
*   @[`bash`][shell-bash]
*   @[`fish`][shell-fish]
*   @[`zsh`][shell-zsh]
