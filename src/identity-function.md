# Identity Function

The __identity function__ is the @[function][functions] that takes a single parameter and 
returns it, unchanged. Though it sounds useless on its own, when doing @[functional programming][]
the identity function often turns out to be useful when writing @[function compositions][function-composition].

To formally express the identity function:

$$
f(x) = x
$$
