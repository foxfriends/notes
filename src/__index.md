# Notes

Here are some notes I have taken on various subjects that I might know something about.
These notes are not intended to replace any official documentation or other information
on each subject, but include the points I feel are most worth knowing, and maybe some
anecdotal experience I have on each subject.

Hopefully over time they will continue to grow, but for now, as I am just beginning to
build them out, they are somewhat scattered and not including all that much of note
that could not have been found easily somewhere else.

These notes are created without much external reference, reflecting more my understanding
of each subject rather than being a reputable source of official information. As such,
if my understanding is wrong, so will be the notes. Take from them what you will. Reach
out (probably by Github [discussion][] or [issue][], or by email for more personal matters)
if you have questions, corrections, comments, or anything else at all.
