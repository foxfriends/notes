# NPM

The __Node Package Manager__. NPM was one of first @[pacakage managers][package-manager] to
really take off due to the way it resolved dependencies at the project level, rather than
the system level, making it much easier to work on separate @[Node.js][] projects using
different versions of the same package without conflict.
