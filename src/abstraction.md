# Abstraction

Abstraction can be used to describe pretty much the entirety of @[software development][].
The process of abstraction is that of taking a complex or specific concept and disguising
it in a way that is much simpler to use and understand in a particular context.
Abstraction is also often used to separate two components to reduce @[coupling][].

Some related reading on abstraction is the @[Law of Leaky Abstractions][], and
my own blog post on [Good Magic][].
