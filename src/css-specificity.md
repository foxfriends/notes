# CSS Specificity

When two @[CSS][] @[selectors][css-selector] apply the same rule to one @[HTML][] element,
the __specificity__ of the selectors is used to determine which should take precedence:
whichever rule has most specificity is used.

Refer to the [MDN documentation][] on how that is calculated, or use the [calculator][]
to find the specificity of a particular selector.
