# Interpreter

A programming language __interpreter__ is a program which reads in the original
source code in a @[programming language][] and interprets it as is to perform the
actions described by the code. This is normally done by a process similar to
compiling, but entirely in memory and on-the-fly.

We call languages which are run using an interpreter "interpreted languages", as
opposed to @[compiled languages][compiler].
