# Scripts

__Scripts__ are (typically) short programs fitting in a single file, which are used to
accomplish a particular task. Scripts are written using a @[scripting language][] and
run via the @[command line][].

Scripts are often used to automate tasks with many steps that the user would otherwise
have to perform manually. Such scripts are often written in a @[shell][] scripting
language and interact with other command line applications.
