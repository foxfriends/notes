# Game Engine

The __game engine__ is the core of any video game. Generally the game engine does not
include any actual game-specific features, and instead only provides a basic framework
in which to build the game, including ways to receive inputs, manage game resources,
and display graphics and sounds.

In @[game development][], though it is possible to build your own game engine, it is 
often easier to just pick an existing one that is available online, especially as the
popular ones also come with tools for managing game assets.

Some possible choices of game engine/game building software include:
*   @[Game Maker][]
*   @[Unreal Engine][]
*   @[Unity][]
*   @[Godot][]
