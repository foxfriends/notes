# Standard Library

Most (if not, all) @[programming languages][programming-language] come with a __standard library__.
Distinct from features built-in to the language (e.g. typically @[control flow][], @[primitive types][],
and general syntax-based semantics), the standard library is a collection of functions, types, and
other useful definitions for building actual applications.

When learning a language, keep in mind this difference: to learn the language is a different task
than to learn its standard library. *The interesting and important part is to learn the language
itself*. Learning the standard library can come later, and typically just happens over time as you
spend time working in language.

Common items to find in a standard library are:
*   Implementations of common types, such as @[strings][] (if not a primitive of the language in 
    question), or collections (@[dictionaries][], @[sets][], @[lists][]).
*   Basic functions, such as those for math (`round()`, `pow()`, etc.).
*   Functions for interacting with the @[operating system][] and @[file system][].
