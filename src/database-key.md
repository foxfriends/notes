# Key (Relational Database)

A __key__ of a @[relation][database-relation] in a @[relational database][] is any column
(or set of multiple columns) which can be used to uniquely identify a row from any other.

In a well formed database, every relation should have exactly one @[primary key][],
but may in fact have many other keys, whether explicitly identified or not.

Other types of keys include:
*   @[Foreign key][]
*   @[Surrogate key][]
*   @[Composite key][]
