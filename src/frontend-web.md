# Frontend Web

Frontend web development involves the creation of webpages, most often using @[HTML][],
@[Javascript][], and @[CSS][].

Rather than using plain old vanilla Javscript and interacting with the DOM directly,
complex web apps tend to be built using some choice of @[frontend framework][frontend-frameworks].

Though all webpages are served and run as HTML/CSS/Javascript, there are other
@[programming languages][] that can be used to develop web applications, typically
by compiling to Javascript, most notably @[TypeScript][], but other options include
@[Elm][], @[ReasonML][], or @[ClojureScript][].
