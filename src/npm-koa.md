# Koa (NPM package)

[Koa](https://koajs.com) is a successor to @[Express][npm-express], providing first-class
support for @[asynchronous][asynchronous-programming] middleware and easier to understand
middleware chaining mechanics.

This is currently my preferred option for developing a @[web server][backend-web] in
@[Node.js][].
