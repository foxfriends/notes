# Self-documenting code

The quest for __self-documenting code__ is a common one. The general idea is that
code should be written in a way that it is clear enough based on the code that no
additional @[documentation][code-documentation] (@[comments][code-comments], or
otherwise) is required for someone to understand it. This is typically achieved by
naming @[functions][], @[variables][] and types well, and breaking down the code
into easily understood parts.

In reality it is not often possible to have code be self-documenting to the degree
that you might want, so it is still important to write comments, but following
self-documenting code ideas remains beneficial.
