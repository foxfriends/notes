# Destructuring

__Destructuring__ is a @[programming language][] feature that allows extracting fields from
structured data using similar syntax as was used to construct that structure. This is similar
to @[multiple variable assignment][], but in the context of structured data.

@[Pattern matching][] is similar to destructuring, but with more flexibility. Where pattern
matching allows patterns to be checked against, destructuring only allows extracting fields
to values, and will not be able to check conditions at the same time. When the data cannot
be destructured as requested, the program will terminate.
