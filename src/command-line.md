# Command Line

A __command line__ is a textual command that is interpreted by a @[shell][] to control
programs running on a computer. Programs may expose a @[command line interface][] by
which they can be used in @[scripts][] or, while also providing a @[graphical user interface][]
through which humans are typically expected to interact with the program using mouse and
keyboard.
