# Software Engineering

One task of @[software development][] is __software engineering__. It is with
software engineering that we connect the concepts of @[computer science][] through
the features of @[programming languages][programming-language] and our knowledge of
the @[hardware][] and @[operating system][] on which the software is run to the
creation of practical applications.

Some software engineering concepts include:
*   @[Functions][], @[methods][], and @[lambdas][]
*   @[Generators][generator-function] and @[coroutines][]
*   @[Asynchronous Programming][] (@[Promises][] and @[`async`/`await`][])
*   @[Concurrency][]
*   @[Exception][] handling
*   @[Security][computer-security]
*   @[Finite State Machines][finite-state-machine]
