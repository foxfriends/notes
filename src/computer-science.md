# Computer Science

The most theoretical part of @[software development][]. The concepts of computer
science come from outside of any @[programming language][] or technology, existing more at
the level of mathematics and logic. It is using the concepts of computer science
that languages are designed, and then using those languages, that software is built.

Some topics in computer science:
*   The @[Lambda Calculus][]
*   @[Boolean][booleans] logic
*   @[Type systems][type-system]
*   The @[monad][]
*   @[DFAs][deterministic-finite-automaton] and @[NFAs][nondeterministic-finite-automaton]
