# Relational Calculus

A __relational calculus__ is a system that can be used to describe the relational model
that is the basis of @[relational databases][relational-database]. In particular, there are 
two relational calculi, the @[tuple relational calculus][] (which I know about) and the
@[domain relational calculus][] (which I do not know so much about, but I assume is similar).

While the relational calculus describes the relational model using concepts of logic, the 
related @[relational algebra][] describes it using functional concepts.
