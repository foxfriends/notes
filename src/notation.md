# Notation

A __notation__ is a tool we use to concretely represent concepts and thoughts using
symbols with accepted meaning. A fancy way to say "write down something".

Important to recognize is that concepts are not bound by notations - when there is
no way to represent a good idea in a known notation, it is time to create a new one.

A @[programming language][] is a type of notation used to represent programs as text.
Other notations include @[mathematical notation][], which hopefully everyone is somewhat
familiar with, and @[logical notation][].
