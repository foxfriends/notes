# Primitive Types

Most @[languages][] feature types, called __primitive types__, which are defined as 
part of the language itself. Typically these are types that would not be possible to 
implement in the @[standard library][] or other user-code due to the semantics of 
the language itself.

The primitive types typically include some or all of the following:
*   Numbers (integer and floating point)
*   Characters
*   @[Booleans][]
*   @[Symbols][symbol-type] or atoms
*   @[Strings][] (typically only higher-level languages)
