# Terminal

A terminal (not to be confused with a @[terminal emulator][]) is a physical device
that provides a text interface. This serves a very similar purpose to a terminal
emulator (to run text based programs), except that it does not run within a @[graphical
interface][graphical-user-interface]. A terminal typically comes with just monitor and
keyboard (no mouse).

It's not all that often that you need to interact with such a terminal directly. You
probably meant to find the terminal emulator page.
