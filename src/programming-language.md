# Programming Language

__Programming Languages__ are used by humans to write code. Often they have different
strengths and weaknesses, and are intended to be used for specific types of applications.

I don't believe in learning a language in particular. More important is to understand
different concepts of @[computer science][] and @[software engineering][] and how they
can be applied to all code written in any language. The language is only used to express
the ideas that the concepts provide.

That said, at the end of the day, code is written in a language so you do need to know
some anyway. Here are some that I may or may not discuss at some point:
*   @[Bash][]
*   @[C][]
*   @[C++][cplusplus]
*   @[CSS][]
*   @[Datalog][]
*   @[Go][go-language]
*   @[GraphQL][]
*   @[Haskell][]
*   @[HTML][]
*   @[Io][io-language]
*   @[Java][]
*   @[Javascript][]
*   @[JSON][]
*   @[Lisp][]
*   @[ML][ml-language]
*   @[Prolog][]
*   @[Python][]
*   @[Ruby][]
*   @[Rust][]
*   @[SQL][]
*   @[Swift][]
*   @[TypeScript][]
*   @[Zig][]

Note that some of those aren't strictly *programming* languages, but languages related
to programming. I think tey might as well go all together.
